# consumescape

A **questionnaire** where you put in information about a product (category) you consider buying and gives you advice on whether you should make that purchase. If you do not buy the product, _it will show you how much in carbon footprint you saved_. Also, the web application will create a **motivational graphic** to share and celebrate with family and friends. If you prefer to buy the product anyways you can start a **30-day timer** to have enough time to reconsider your purchase and thus, avoid impulsive buying behaviour.
